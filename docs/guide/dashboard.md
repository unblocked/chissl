# Dashboard Tips

- Right-aligned action buttons; tables auto-refresh every ~10s
- Listeners tables refresh immediately after create/delete
- Tunnels show active/open first; limit to latest 15 items
- Unified Events modal for tunnels and multicast (live/recent/search)
- Port reservations visible on main dashboard; smart port validation
- Filterable dropdowns for user selection; persist "Show closed" toggles
- Consistent button styling; port values shown as plain text
- Documentation menu links to GitHub Pages docs
